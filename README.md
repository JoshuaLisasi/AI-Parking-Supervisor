## Overview

![alt text](parkingdemo.gif)

There are many ways to supervise a parking lot with computer vision , however , I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one.

I wanted to have a plug and play parking lot supervisor.
I think this is it.

Parking spots can have different shapes based on the angle the camera sees them from.
And I wanted to adress that.
